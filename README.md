# Azure Event Hubs System API Example
In the current revision, this repository contains a sample system API to illustrate how to integrate with Azure Event Hubs.
- The folder **anypoint-studio-project** includes the implementation of a simple API that exposes a single resource, `/events`, and one method, `POST`, which publishes the request body to Azure Event Hubs.
- The folder **documentation** contains a how to guide for integrating with Azure Event Hubs. First, it guides you through my approach to configuring my Azure account and provisioning all the required resources. Then, it describes the sample system API to illustrate how to integrate with Azure Event Hubs.
- The folder **postman-collection** contains the basic Postman collection I used to learn and test how to use the Azure APIs to integrate with Azure Event Hubs.
